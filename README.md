## 💀 What is this?

**Loose Pockets** introduces a high-stakes "Sonic-style" mechanic to *The Binding of Isaac: Repentance*. When you take damage, you don't just lose health—**you physically drop your passive items onto the floor!**

It transforms every hit into a moment of panic. Do you dive into danger to save your *Sacred Heart*, or let it vanish forever to stay alive?

### ✨ Why players love it:
- **⚠️ The Panic:** Getting hit ejects 1–2 random items from your inventory.
- **💨 The Scramble:** Items are flung away with physics. You have to chase them down!
- **⏳ The Timer:** Dropped items flicker and **vanish after 5 seconds**. If you're too slow, they are gone forever.
- **🛡️ Anti-Softlock:** Critical story items (Polaroid, Negative, Key Pieces) are **Blacklisted** and will never drop.

## ⚙️ Configuration (NEW!)

**Now with full [Mod Config Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2487535818) support!**

You no longer need to edit code. Just open the menu in-game (usually `L` or `F10`) to customize your suffering:

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Drop Chance** | Percentage chance to drop an item on hit (0-100%). |
| **Despawn Time** | How long items stay on the floor (1s - 60s). |
| **Max Drops** | Limit how many items spew out at once. |
| **Pickup Delay** | Add a cooldown before you can reclaim items (for extra chaos). |
| **Panic Mode** | *Hardcore:* Dropped items appear as "?" (Blind) sprites. |

*(If you don't have Mod Config Menu installed, the mod runs with balanced default settings).*
